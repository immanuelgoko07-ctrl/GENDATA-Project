# ðŸ“Š Cryptocurrency Historical Data â€” README

## 1. Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive dataset capturing **historical cryptocurrency market data** across several years. It records daily trading metrics such as **Open**, **High**, **Low**, **Close**, and **Volume**, as well as identifiers including **ticker** and **name**.

Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that rely on blockchain technology and decentralized networks. Their prices are influenced by investor sentiment, global regulations, macroeconomic events, and market liquidity.
This dataset provides a valuable foundation for **data analysis, predictive modeling, machine learning, and financial research**.

The data can be used to explore:

* Market cycles and volatility.
* Price correlations among cryptocurrencies.
* Long-term performance and investment trends.
* Forecasting future prices using statistical and AI models.

## 2. Dataset Description

The dataset file is named **`Crypto_historical_data.csv`** and contains **337,393 records** with **8 key columns**.

| Column   | Type     | Description                                          |
| :------- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| `Date`   | datetime | Timestamp of the market data record                  |
| `Open`   | float    | Opening price at the beginning of the trading day    |
| `High`   | float    | Highest price reached during the trading period      |
| `Low`    | float    | Lowest price recorded in that period                 |
| `Close`  | float    | Closing price at the end of the trading day          |
| `Volume` | integer  | Total amount traded (in units of the cryptocurrency) |
| `ticker` | string   | Abbreviated trading pair (e.g., BTC-USD, ETH-USD)    |
| `name`   | string   | Full cryptocurrency name (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum)   |

This structure follows standard financial data conventions, ensuring compatibility with tools like **Excel, Python (Pandas), R, or Power BI**.

## 3. Data Source and Collection Method

The data originates from **public cryptocurrency APIs** such as:

* **Yahoo Finance**
* **CoinMarketCap**
* **CryptoCompare**
* **Binance and Coinbase APIs**

It was most likely collected through **automated scripts** that periodically fetch and aggregate trading data from multiple exchanges.

Each row in the dataset corresponds to a **daily trading snapshot**, standardized across various cryptocurrencies for consistency.

Typical steps in the collection process include:

1. Pulling daily data from an exchangeâ€™s REST API.
2. Formatting the response into CSV-ready structures.
3. Cleaning and merging multiple sources to avoid duplicates.
4. Verifying data accuracy through consistency checks.

## 4. Data Schema and Structure

The dataset schema:

```
Crypto_historical_data.csv
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Date: datetime64[ns]
â”œâ”€â”€ Open: float64
â”œâ”€â”€ High: float64
â”œâ”€â”€ Low: float64
â”œâ”€â”€ Close: float64
â”œâ”€â”€ Volume: int64
â”œâ”€â”€ ticker: object
â””â”€â”€ name: object
```

* **File Type:** CSV
* **Encoding:** UTF-8
* **Rows:** 337,393
* **Columns:** 8
* **Memory Size:** ~20 MB

This makes it ideal for both local data analysis and cloud-based processing.

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before analysis, itâ€™s essential to perform **EDA** to understand trends, missing data, and distributions.

### Observations:

* The dataset contains continuous daily data for multiple cryptocurrencies.
* `Close` and `Open` prices align closely, with expected volatility.
* `Volume` indicates market activity and liquidity trends.
* Minor missing values appear in `Open`, `High`, and `Low`.

### Example Python Exploration

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("Crypto_historical_data.csv")
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

print(df.describe())

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.plot(df['Date'], df['Close'])
plt.title('Closing Price Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price (USD)')
plt.show()
```

### Example Statistics (illustrative)

| Metric  |     Open |     High |      Low |    Close |
| :------ | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: |
| Mean    |   230.42 |   245.61 |   215.78 |   232.00 |
| Std Dev |    95.32 |   103.55 |    89.45 |    97.22 |
| Min     |     1.02 |     1.05 |     0.95 |     1.00 |
| Max     | 65000.00 | 67000.00 | 63000.00 | 66500.00 |

## 6. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Cleaning steps ensure reliability before analysis or modeling.

### Recommended Steps:

1. **Date Parsing:** Convert `Date` to datetime objects.
2. **Handling Missing Values:** Use forward-fill or interpolation for price columns.
3. **Duplicate Removal:** Eliminate repeated rows (common in merged datasets).
4. **Sorting:** Sort by `name` and `Date` for time-series consistency.
5. **Type Conversion:** Ensure all numeric fields are floats.

### Example Code

```python
df = pd.read_csv("Crypto_historical_data.csv")
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
df = df.drop_duplicates()
df = df.fillna(method='ffill')
df = df.sort_values(by=['name', 'Date'])
```

### Validation

After cleaning, confirm:

* No missing or duplicate rows.
* Correct chronological order.
* Consistent price logic (`Low` â‰¤ `Open` â‰¤ `High`).

import seaborn as sns

sns.lineplot(x='Date', y='Close', hue='name', data=df)
plt.title('Price Trends by Cryptocurrency')
plt.show()
```

### Correlation Heatmap Example

```python
corr = df[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume']].corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True)
```

## 9. Limitations and Ethical Considerations

### Limitations

* Data may lack full exchange coverage (some coins missing).
* Older records might have fewer data points or irregular intervals.
* Incomplete metadata (no market cap, exchange info).

### Ethical Considerations

* Predictions should **not** be interpreted as financial advice.
* Users must adhere to **API terms and licensing** from data sources.
* Avoid using insights for **market manipulation**.
* Transparency in model assumptions is crucial when publishing results.
